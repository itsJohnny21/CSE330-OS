## CSE330 Project-2 Kernel Module and System Call

In this directory, there are two scripts available for student testing convenience.

### [test_module.sh](https://github.com/visa-lab/CSE330-OS/blob/project-2/test_module.sh)

This script can be used to test the kernel module. It will do the following after unzipping the provided zip file:

[Total Score]: 50 out of 50 (this is NOT your final grade)
NOTE: This script does not check the content of your screenshot.
      Check grading rubric for details, the grader will inspect
      the text within the screenshots.
```

Note, the autograder script will need to deduct points from the points given in this script if the screenshot content is incorrect.

### [test_resubmission.sh](https://github.com/visa-lab/CSE330-OS/blob/project-2/test_resubmission.sh)

This script can be used to test the syscall. It will do the following after unzipping the provided zip file:

```bash
./test_resubmission.sh /path/to/zip/file.zip
```

Expected Output:
```
NOTE: This script is only meant for testing P1 resubmission

```

Note, you ONLY need to run this script if you are planning to have your Project 1 regraded. If you are satisfied with your Project 1 grade, you do not need to worry about this script OR include a Project1 directory in your submission.

### [utils.sh](https://github.com/CSE330-OS/GTA-CSE330-Fall2024/blob/main/Project2/testing/utils.sh)

This script is not meant to be run directly, and only contains code that is used in both scripts mentioned above.

### Note

- Please do not make changes in provided test code to pass the test cases.
- You can use print statements in case you want to debug and understand the logic of the test code (the diagrams may also be useful).
- Please get in touch with the TAs if you face issues in using the test scripts.
